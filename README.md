# CS6910-Deep-Learning
The assignments for the course CS6910-Fundamentals of Deep Learning 2021 taught by Prof. Mitesh Khapra.

## [Assignment 1:](https://wandb.ai/r1tv1k/cs6910-a1/reports/Assignment-1--Vmlldzo1MjcwMTg)
Implementing a feedforward neural network with backpropagation and testing it on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. wandbi.ai was the tool used.

## [Assignment 2:](https://wandb.ai/r1tv1k/cs6910-a2/reports/Assignment-2--Vmlldzo1OTkyNTQ)
Using CNNs - training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models (EfficientNet, Xception, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50) for the 
[inaturalist dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/wandb_datasets/nature_12K.zip) .

## [Assignment 3:](https://wandb.ai/r1tv1k/cs6910-a3/reports/Assignment-3--Vmlldzo3MjQxMTI)
Using recurrent neural networks for a transliteration system. The model was tested on the [Dakshina dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/dakshina) by Google.
